     * Create a nullable int

        * check if it has a value using the proper method
     * Create a nullable string
        * string are reference types, null values are possible by default, but by marking with ? it will tell the compiler to generate warnings if null cases are not treated    
        * print the length of the string; check if it is not null (2 methods)
     * Create a string member and initialize it with null; then, tell the compiler that there are no cases in which that variable will be null
